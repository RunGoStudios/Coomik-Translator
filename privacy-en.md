**Last updated: January 15, 2026**

---

## 1. Introduction
Welcome to Coomik Translator. This Privacy Policy explains how Coomik Translator ("we", "our", or "the App") collects, uses, and protects information when you use our mobile application. We are committed to respecting your privacy and ensuring transparency about how your data is handled.

---

## 2. Information Collection and Use

### 2.1. Personal Data
We do not collect, store, or explicitly share personally identifiable information (such as your name, email address, or phone number). The App is designed to function primarily as a local tool for translating comic files stored on your device.

### 2.2. Files and Media Content
The App requires access to your device storage to read and process comic files (.zip, .cbz, images) that you choose to translate.

- **Local Processing:** We use on-device machine learning technologies (Google ML Kit) for Optical Character Recognition (OCR) and text detection. This processing occurs entirely on your device, and no raw image data is sent to our servers.  
- **Cloud Processing (Optional):** If you choose to use the “Gemini” translation model (Google AI), the text extracted from images will be sent to the Google Gemini API for translation. We do not store this content on our servers; it is processed by Google according to their own privacy policies and AI terms of service.

### 2.3. Advertising and Device Data
The App uses third-party services that may collect information used to identify you for advertising and analytics purposes.

- **Google AdMob:** We use AdMob to display ads. AdMob may collect device identifiers (such as the Android Advertising ID), IP address, and usage data to provide personalized ads and measure advertising performance.

---

## 3. App Permissions
Coomik Translator requests the following permissions to function properly:

- **Storage (Read/Write):** Required to select comic files from your device and to save translated or exported versions.  
- **Internet/Network:** Required to connect to the Google Gemini API (for AI translations) and to load ads via AdMob.  
- **Notifications:** Used to notify you when a long or background translation process is completed.

## 4. Third-Party Services
We may use third-party companies and services to facilitate our service. We recommend reviewing their privacy policies:

- Google ML Kit: https://developers.google.com/ml-kit/terms

## 5. Data Security
We value your trust in using our App. We employ commercially acceptable means to protect your data. However, please remember that no method of transmission over the internet or electronic storage is 100% secure.  
Importantly, we **do not** back up or store your personal comic files on our servers.

## 6. Children’s Privacy
Our services are not directed to children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13.
