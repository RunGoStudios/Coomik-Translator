**Coomik Translator Privacy Policy**

**Last updated: January 15, 2026**

**1. Introduction**
Welcome to Coomik Translator. This Privacy Policy explains how Coomik Translator (“we”, “our”, or “the App”) collects, uses, and protects information when you use our mobile application. We are committed to respecting your privacy and ensuring transparency regarding how your data is handled.

**2. Information Collection and Use**

**2.1. Personal Data**
We do not collect, store, or explicitly share personally identifiable information (such as your name, email address, or phone number). The App is designed to function primarily as a local tool for translating comic files stored on your device.

**2.2. Files and Media Content**
The App requires access to your device’s storage to read and process the comic files (.zip, .cbz, images) that you choose to translate.

* **Local Processing:** We use on-device machine learning technologies (Google ML Kit) for Optical Character Recognition (OCR) and text detection. This processing happens entirely on your device, and raw image data is not sent to our servers.
* **Cloud Processing (Optional):** If you choose to use the “Gemini” translation model (Google's Artificial Intelligence), the extracted text from images will be sent to the Google Gemini API for translation. We do not store this content on our servers; it is processed by Google according to their own privacy policies and AI terms of service.

**2.3. Advertising and Device Data**
The App uses third-party services that may collect information used to identify you for advertising and analytics purposes.

* **Google AdMob:** We use AdMob to display ads. AdMob may collect device identifiers (such as the Android Advertising ID), IP address, and usage data to provide personalized ads and measure advertising performance.

**3. App Permissions**
Coomik Translator requests the following permissions to function correctly:

* **Storage (Read/Write):** Needed to select comic files on your device and to save translated or exported versions.
* **Internet/Network:** Required to connect to the Google Gemini API (for AI-based translations) and to load AdMob ads.
* **Notifications:** Used to inform you when a long translation process running in the background has been completed.

**4. Third-Party Services**
We may use companies and third-party services to assist in providing our service. We recommend reviewing the privacy policies of these providers:

* Google Play Services: [https://policies.google.com/privacy](https://policies.google.com/privacy)
* AdMob (Google): [https://support.google.com/admob/answer/6128543](https://support.google.com/admob/answer/6128543)
* Google Gemini API: [https://policies.google.com/privacy](https://policies.google.com/privacy)
* Google ML Kit: [https://developers.google.com/ml-kit/terms](https://developers.google.com/ml-kit/terms)

**5. Data Security**
We value your trust in using our App. We employ commercially acceptable means to protect your data. However, please remember that no method of transmission over the internet or electronic storage is 100% secure. It is important to note that we do not back up or store your personal comic files on our servers.

**6. Children’s Privacy**
Our services are not directed to children under 13 years old. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13.

**7. Changes to This Privacy Policy**
We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We recommend reviewing this page periodically to check for any changes. We will notify you of updates by publishing the new Privacy Policy on this page.
