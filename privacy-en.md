# Privacy Policy

**Last updated: January 19, 2026**

Your privacy is important to us. This Privacy Policy explains how the **Coomik Translator** app (“we,” “our,” or “the App”) collects, uses, stores, and shares your information. By using our App, you agree to the practices described in this policy.

## 1. Information We Collect

The App is designed to prioritize local processing and minimize data collection. However, to provide certain features (such as advanced AI translation and advertising), some data may be processed by third parties.

### 1.1. User-Provided Data

* **Image and Text Files**: To perform translations, the App accesses files (images, comics, manga) that you select from your device storage.
* **Content for Translation**: Text blocks extracted from images may be sent to cloud services (Google Gemini) exclusively for translation purposes, if this translation option is enabled.

### 1.2. Automatically Collected Data

* **Device Identifiers**: The App uses advertising services (Google AdMob) that may collect advertising identifiers (such as the Android Advertising ID) and usage data to display personalized or non-personalized ads.
* **Purchase Data**: When you make subscriptions or in-app purchases (“Premium”), transactions are processed by the Google Play Store. We only receive purchase confirmation and subscription status, without access to your financial information (credit card number, etc.).

## 2. How We Use Your Information

We use the collected information to:

* **Provide the Service**: Perform OCR (Optical Character Recognition) and translate content from images.
* **Improvements and Fixes**: Monitor app performance and fix errors (anonymous crash logs via Google Play Console).
* **Advertising**: Display interstitial ads through Google AdMob (for free-version users).
* **Subscription Management**: Verify and manage your “Premium” status to remove ads and unlock features.

## 3. Sharing with Third Parties

We do not sell your personal information. We only share data with essential service providers necessary for the App to function:

* **Google Gemini (Generative AI)**:

  * We use the Google Gemini API to provide high-quality translations.
  * Text extracted from your images is sent to Google servers for processing and returned in translated form.
  * Please refer to the [Google Gemini API Privacy Policy and Terms](https://ai.google.dev/terms).

* **Google ML Kit (On-Device)**:

  * We use Google ML Kit for OCR and offline translation.
  * ML Kit processing occurs primarily **on-device**, without sending images to the cloud, ensuring greater privacy for text recognition.

* **Google AdMob**:

  * Displays ads within the App and may collect data for ad personalization.
  * Please refer to the [Google Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy).

* **Google Play Billing**:

  * Processes payments and subscriptions.

## 4. Device Permissions

The App requests the following permissions to function properly:

* **Storage (Read/Write)**: Required to read the comic/image files you select and to save translated or exported versions.
* **Internet/Network Access**: Required to connect to translation APIs (Gemini), load ads (AdMob), and verify subscriptions.
* **Notifications**: Used to inform you about background translation progress or task completion.

## 5. Data Security

We implement reasonable security measures to protect your information. However, please note that no method of internet transmission or electronic storage is 100% secure.

* Content translated via the Gemini API is transmitted securely (HTTPS).
* We do not store copies of your files on our servers; they remain on your device.

## 6. Children’s Privacy

The App is not directed at children under the age of 13, and we do not knowingly collect personal information from children. Translated content is the sole responsibility of the user, who must ensure that the accessed files are appropriate.

## 7. Your Rights

Depending on your jurisdiction (such as LGPD in Brazil or GDPR in Europe), you may have rights regarding your data, including access, correction, or deletion. Since most data is processed locally or anonymously by third parties, you may exercise your rights:

* **In the App**: By clearing storage data in Android settings.
* **With Partners**: By managing ad preferences through your Google account settings.

## 8. Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We recommend reviewing this page periodically for any changes. Updates take effect immediately upon publication.

## 9. Contact
