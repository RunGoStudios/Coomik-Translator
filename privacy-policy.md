Privacy Policy for Coomik Translator

Last updated: January 13, 2026

1. Introduction
Welcome to Coomik Translator. This Privacy Policy explains how Coomik Translator ("we", "us", or "our") collects, uses, and discloses information about you when you use our mobile application (the "App").

2. Information Collection and Use

2.1. Personal Data
We do not explicitly collect or store personal identification information (such as your name, email address, or phone number). The App is designed to function primarily as a tool for translating comic files stored locally on your device.

2.2. Files and Media
The App requires access to your device's storage to read comic files (archives or images) that you choose to translate.
- Local Processing: We use on-device machine learning technologies (Google ML Kit) for Optical Character Recognition (OCR) and some translation tasks. This processing happens on your device.
- Cloud Processing: If you choose to use the "Gemini" translation model, the text extracted from your images is sent to Google's Gemini API for translation. We do not store this content on our own servers; it is processed by Google in accordance with their privacy policies.

2.3. Device Information and Log Data
The App uses third-party services that may collect information used to identify you.
- Google Mobile Ads (AdMob): We use AdMob to display advertisements. AdMob may collect data such as your device's advertising ID, IP address, and usage data to provide personalized ads and analytics.

3. Third-Party Services
We may use third-party companies and services to facilitate our App and provide its services. Valid links to the privacy policies of the third-party service providers used by the App are:

- Google Play Services: https://policies.google.com/privacy
- AdMob (Google): https://support.google.com/admob/answer/6128543?hl=en
- Google Gemini API: https://policies.google.com/privacy
- Google ML Kit: https://developers.google.com/ml-kit/terms

4. Permissions
The App requests the following permissions to function:
- Storage/Files: To select and save translated comic files.
- Internet/Network: To fetch translations from the Gemini API and to load advertisements.
- Notifications: To notify you when a long-running translation task is complete.

5. Data Security
We value your trust in providing us your information (via the files you process). While no method of transmission over the internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure, we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect it. We do not store your comic files on our servers.

6. Children's Privacy
Our Services do not address anyone under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13.

7. Changes to This Privacy Policy
We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page periodically for any changes. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.
